# Psychic-Game
A game where the user has to guess what letter the computer is thinking of, made using Javascript, HTML (and Bootstrap), and CSS.

## How to Play
The computer chooses a random letter for the user to guess, and the user has 10 tries to guess the letter. If the user does not guess the letter after 10 tries, they lose.

*Note: Pressing the same letter more than once only counts as one guess.*
